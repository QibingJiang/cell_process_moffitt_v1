First, download the executable program:
git clone https://github.com/QibingJiang/cell_process_moffitt.git

Second, run the following command,
cd cell_process_moffitt
chmod a=rwx ./cell_process/cell_process
./cell_process/cell_process configure.txt input_dir
input_dir is the directory where the images are. For example, 
./cell_process/cell_process configure.txt /home/qibing/disk_t/Pt204/RawData/Beacon-2

You do not need to specify output directory. The result would be put into the TimeLapseVideos folder under each patient folder. For example: "/home/qibing/disk_t/Pt204/TimeLapseVideos/"

In the TimeLapseVideos folder, 

images_ucf contains all the images after preprocessing that is brightness adjustment and video stabilization. Results_ucf contains files Results_*.csv, each of which is the live cell area for one Beacon. 

videos_ucf contains videos, in each of which, the cells are classified in to live and dead two categories. In the video, the cells in blue circles are live, and yellow for dead. 

info_ucf contains other information. The file named Beacon_*_cell_tracks.txt contains the information for each cell track. In this file, each row represents one image (one time point). the 5 columns are x-coordinate, y-coordinate, cell area, cell core brightness average, eccentricity. The coordinates origin is at the top left corner of the image. Image size is 1328(width)x1048(height). x-coordinate is horizontaly, and always positive. y-coordinate is vertically, and always positive. 

In the file named Beacon_*_live_dead_table.txt, each row represents one image (one time point). The 4 columns are the number of live cells, the number of dead cells, the area sum of live cells, the area sum of dead cells.
